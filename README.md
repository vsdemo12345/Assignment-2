1. Create a repository on GitHub and clone it on to your local machine.
2. In that repository's local machine directory, write a Java program that accepts 3 numbers from the user and finds the sum of the smallest and the largest. Test it.
3. Once the program is working fine, push it to the repository.
4. Verify the push.
5. Create a Docker image for running this program.
6. Run the program using this Docker image.
7. Run a Tomcat/Apache/Nginx server using Kubernetes as a deployment using a yaml file. Have 3 replicas. Verify that it is running. Then redeploy to have 5 replicas. Then stop the deployment.
8. Use Docker to deploy a Tomcat/Apache/nginx server. Verify that it can be accessed. Then stop it. Now deploy this as a Kubernetes deployment with three instances. Delete one of the pods and prove that a new pod got created.
